# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

#### Your answer:
[add your answer here]   
1: header, contains info of properties of method, name, parameters   
2: the output type of the method
3: name of method  
4: parameter type  
5: parameter  
6: initializing value
7: the body of the method  
8: the returning output from the method  

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
The constructor is invoke to create an instance (objects) from the class 
blueprint. We use it when we want to create an object of the class. 
Exemple: if we have a car class and we want to create a new car object 
as newCar, we use the consturctor from the car class blueprint. We can have
more constructor than one, if in different constructors we initialises 
more fields from the class.
